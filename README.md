This app has various screens to display all Wifi networks, what Wifi channels they're using, and signal strengths.

It currently has two display screens:
- The first screen lists all Wifi networks with the channel number they're using in descending strength.
- The second screen shows a graphic display of what networks are using what channel and how strong they are showing overlapping usage.

I'm not very happy with screen 2, too much overlap, too hard to read network names.

Change History:
- v0.1 Add second screen
